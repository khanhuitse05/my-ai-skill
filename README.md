Simple collection of custom Cursor AI skills that I use frequently.

## Skills

- **code-quality-report**  
  Produces a structured code quality assessment report for Frontend (Mobile & Web) or Backend codebases using shared templates.

### How to use

**Installation:**

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/khanhuitse05/my-ai-skill --skill code-quality-report
```

**Usage:**

After installation, simply prompt Cursor AI with any of the following:

- `Generate a code quality report for this frontend project`
- `Create a backend code quality assessment`
- `Review code quality for mobile app`
- `Generate quality assessment report`
- `Codebase review report`
- `Frontend vs backend quality report`
- `Export report as markdown file`

The skill will automatically detect the platform (Frontend/Backend) and generate a comprehensive assessment report following IEEE 730/1016/829 standards, Clean Code principles, and OWASP security guidelines.
