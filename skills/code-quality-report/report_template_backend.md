## 3. Dependencies, Libraries & Framework Review

### 3.1 Framework(s) and current version

| Item        | Current version | Notes (e.g. EOL, LTS) |
| ----------- | --------------- | ----------------------- |
| _(e.g. Node / Go / Java / .NET)_ | X.Y.Z | _(LTS until… / EOL…)_ |
| _(runtime / language)_            | X.Y.Z | |

### 3.2 Key libraries and versions

| Package / library   | Current | Latest  | Status              |
| ------------------- | ------- | ------ | ------------------- |
| _(name)_            | X.Y.Z   | X.Y.Z  | Up to date / Behind |
| _(name)_            | X.Y.Z   | X.Y.Z  |                     |

**Direct dependency count:** XX | **Outdated (total):** XX _(minor/patch: XX, major: XX)_

### 3.3 Upgrade suggestions

- **Safe to upgrade (patch/minor):** _(list or “None” / “See table above”)_
- **Suggest upgrade (minor/major, some risk):** _(list with suggested version)_
- **Major upgrade recommended:** _(e.g. framework or critical lib; note migration effort)_

### 3.4 Technical risks

- _(Deprecated APIs; packages nearing EOL; incompatibilities; lockfile or resolution issues.)_

### 3.5 Security and vulnerabilities

- **Audit summary:** _(e.g. npm audit / govulncheck / Snyk)_ — Critical: XX | High: XX | Medium: XX | Low: XX
- **Critical / High:** _(Package name, CVE or advisory, recommended fix e.g. “upgrade to X.Y.Z”)_
- **License risks:** _(if any)_

## 9. Architecture & Database Diagrams

### 9.1 Architecture Diagram

_(Automatically generated Mermaid diagram showing service layers, API structure, and key modules)_

```mermaid
graph TB
    Client[Client App] --> API[API Gateway]
    API --> Auth[Auth Service]
    API --> User[User Service]
    API --> Order[Order Service]
    User --> DB[(Database)]
    Order --> DB
    Order --> Payment[Payment API]
```

_Description: This diagram shows the high-level architecture with API gateway routing to services, and data flow to the database._

### 9.2 Database Diagram

_(Automatically generated Mermaid ER diagram showing main entities and relationships)_

```mermaid
erDiagram
    USER ||--o{ ORDER : places
    ORDER ||--|{ ORDER_ITEM : contains
    PRODUCT ||--o{ ORDER_ITEM : "ordered in"
    USER {
        int id PK
        string email
        string name
    }
    ORDER {
        int id PK
        int user_id FK
        date created_at
    }
```

_Description: This diagram shows the main database entities and their relationships identified from the codebase._
